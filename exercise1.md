For this discussion, Python is the chosen programming language. In a typical CI setup for Python, common steps include linting, testing, and building. Linting is often handled using tools such as Flake8 or Pylint, which help enforce coding standards and detect potential errors early. Testing is commonly done with pytest, a powerful and widely used testing framework that supports unit, integration, and functional tests. For building and packaging Python applications, tools like setuptools, wheel, or Poetry are frequently used to create distributable artifacts.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, there are several alternative CI tools available. Popular options include GitLab CI/CD, which is tightly integrated with GitLab repositories, CircleCI, known for its speed and ease of configuration, and Travis CI, which has long been used for open-source projects. Other options like Azure DevOps Pipelines and Bitbucket Pipelines also provide robust CI capabilities.

Choosing between a self-hosted or cloud-based CI setup depends on factors such as security, scalability, cost, and maintenance effort. Cloud-based CI is often better for most teams because it is easier to scale, requires less maintenance, and offers faster setup. However, self-hosted CI may be preferred when strict data control, custom infrastructure, or compliance requirements are involved. To make this decision, information about team size, budget, security needs, and workload frequency would be essential.
